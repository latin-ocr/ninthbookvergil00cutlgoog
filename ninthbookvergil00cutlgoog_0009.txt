PREFACE. V

the accusative form is sometimes followed by the same
case as the verb. But a like construction is found with
other words whose intimate connection was felt with the
verb-group, —with verbal adjectives in -oundus and with
verbal nouns in rio. Second, it is used in the accusative

ᾗ to denote purpose. But this is a survival of the accusa·
³ tive of limit, or goal of motion, a construction familiar in
, Homer, and in Latin persisting in the names of towns
. ¹and in a few other words in common use, as rtis and

domum.
lt may possibly be said that the view here presented

’ should lead to abolishing the supine entirely. The
J editor would have no obiection to such a step; but the

regular use of the word in forming the future infinitivo
passive would still justify recognizing it as in its deriva-
tion belonging to the verb-group.¹

η Except in the instance mentioned derivation has been

given, with few exceptions, as in Lewis's Elementary

¹ In the Notes on line 241, — ¹

. . . si fortuna permittitis uti,
quaesitum Aenean . . .

in order not to confuse the pupil by any novel view, quaesitum is
called a supine. It would seem more reasonable to consider it a
verbal noun in apposition with fortuna uti: “ if . . . ‚ that is, if you
accord me the going-to-seek . . . .'' If it were not one of the com·
paratively few instances extant in which the ‘supine’takes an object,
this view would probably be accepted.

Some of the verbals in question are found in supine construction-s
only, but these are probably less numerous than recognized verbal
nouns which are found in the ablative only, or in the accusative and
the ablative.
