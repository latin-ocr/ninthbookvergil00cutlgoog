noras, 71

762 Phalerim—critice. Most oi the warriors here enumer-
ated are not mentioned elsewhere in the Aeneid. The names are
nearly all horrowed from Homer, but they do not designate the
same persons; eg„ the four in line 767 are killed by Ulysses in
the Iliad, and Homer's Clytius is a son of Laomedon. Phegeus was
associated with Sagaris as a famulus in V. 263 (see note on line
569), but we cannot with any confidence identify these subordinate
personages‚ as in Book XII. we find Turnus killing again a Phegeus
(371, seq.)‚ an Amycus (509), and a Cretheus (538), while a Clytius
who is a mere lad is found in Book X. (32 5). Amycus is mentioned
in Book 1. 221 as a friend especially esteemed by Aeneas, and the
name is also applied to a Bithynian prince in V. 373.

763 hinc τ from them. fugientibus: those who were still fleeing
before him; see line 7 56; he first caught and disabled with his
sword Phaleris and GygeS, and then, snatching their spears, he
hurled them at the backs of the fleeing Trojans.

765 comitem: to those whom he has already slain.

766 ignitos in, mritis Mirtemque cientis: on che walls, un-
awarc (ff his nearness, and carrying on the contest. deindo: dis·
syllable ; so in line 781 below.

767 Noemonaque: the final syllable is here lengthened because of
the two consonants at the beginning of the next word ; an irregular
usage in Latin, although common in Greek, as in the line of Homer
which Vergil has here almost exactly transliterated.

769 ab aggere dexter: on the right os Lynceus as the latter
approached from the rampart ; Lynceus came toward Turnus from
the wall on the left hand of Turnus.

772 felicior ungere: more successful at smearing with poison;
ungere and armiro depend on felicior, a poetical construction
instead of the ablative of the gerund or the gerundive.

773 munit: with eupcrtness, skilfully. -que : see note on line 306.

776 cordi: see note on line 615. numerosque intendere nervis :
and accompanying lu's poetry nitu the lyrc, lit. ‘adapting his poetic
numbers to stringed instruments.’ The sequence of thought is: he
liked poetry and the lyre‚ and liked to chant verses to the accom-
paniment of the lyre; he was always singing of, etc. Ladewig
