56911ioneus—Themillse. This enumeration of not especially
conspicuous indIvidual warriors isin imitation of similar passages
in Homer. Observe the altemation ot the slayers and the slain.
The names ol the Trojans are of course all Greek, and here in many
cases distinguished as such by the Greek inflections. Three of them
only, Ilioneus, Caeneus, and Capys are borrowed from Homer, but
the personages are not the same. Lucetium, Liger, Asilas, Ortygium,
Turnus, Privernum, and Themillae are names oi Italians, two of
them apparently not of the Italian dialects kindred with the Latin,
but showing the influenee ol the Greek colonies in Italy. Of the
Trojans most are not mentioned elsewhere. Ilioneus was an aged
warrior, the spokesman of the Trojans at the court of Dido. Cory-
naeus took an important part in the ceremonies at the cremation of
Misenus. Capys was promInent at Troy, and commanded one ot the
ships of the fleet oi Aeneas. Sagaris, if the same as In V. 263,is
there called a famulus, but possibly nothIng more is meant by this
appellation than that he assisted in the arrangements at the funeral ’
games. For similar enumerations of names see lines 684, 6853
