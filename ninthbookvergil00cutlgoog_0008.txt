iv PREFACE.

Dr. Tetlow's Vocabulary to the eighth book of the
Aeneid is probably the only work embodying the most
recent views in etymology, in which the derivation oi
verbals in -us has been treated systematically and con·
sistently. Some he refers to roms, and others'to verbs,
but in every case for a definite reason. In the Vocabu-
lary of the present work the editor has been permitted‚
in the exercise ol his own judgment, to refer all such
nouns to the verbs.

The complete conjugation ol a verb is made up oi
forms derived from the same root or stem at different
periods and in different ways, but ior convenience
grouped together. In referring to the verb the verbal
in -us‚ it is meant simply that the word belongs closely to
the same group. It is believed by the editor to be iden·
tical with the supine, a noun often found in other forms
than the accusative and the ablative (locative) singular.
Since the supine is now universally recognized as annun,
it seems reasonable that nouns like auditus and visus,
for instance, should not be considered different words
when in the ablative, and when iu the nominative with
identical meaning. Nor should it be an objection that
such nouns have often become concrete, or even collec-
tive, and that they are more commonly used as such than
as pure abstract verbals. A similar change oi meaning,
or union of such meanings in one word, is common in all
languages

The traditioual treatment of the supine as a special
form ol the verb appears ascribable to two causes¹ F irst,
