PREFACE.

-000-

In the preparation of the present work the effort has
been made to follow as closely as possible the methods
proposed by the editors-in-chiei ol the series oi School
Classics to which it belongs. ln pursuance ot this course
personal opinions on points comparatively unimportant
’ have yielded cheeriully, as they should, to uniformity ol
treatment. For instance, the editor oi this work would
not otherwise have listed together in the Vocabulary
. words beginning with i vowel, and those beginning with i
consonant.

Although in an elementary text-book it would have
been inappropriate to emphasize matters oi purely lin·
guistic interest, attention has been called occasionally in
the Notes to the coordinate use of the passive voice as

middle, and of the active with a reflexive object. The
Romance languages in their numerous reflexive verbs
lurnish, in analytic form, perfect illustration of the devel-
opment oi the middle voice, both direct and indirect, and
ot the relation oi the middle voice to the passive. A
few suggestive examples from the French have been
given in the Notes.
