the fall of Troy has founded the city of Argyripa in Apulia.
Meanwhile at the Trojan camp the river god Tiber appears to
Aeneas in a dream, and, predicting the ultimate success ol his
enterprise, directs him to proceed up the river and seek the
alliance of the Arcadian king Evander at Pallanteum, the
future site oi Rome. The following evening Aeneas sails up
the river, and reaches Pallanteum the next day at noon. He
finds Evander engaged in a festival in honor of Hercules. He
is welcomed as a distant relative, a renowned hero, and the son
oi the distinguished Anchises, and accepts the invitation of
Evander to participate in the least ln explanation of the
origin of the festival Evander recites the story ol Cacus. At
night Aeneas sleeps in the humble abode ot Evander. Mean·
, while his mother Venus visits Vulcan, and succeeds in persuad-
’ · ing him to forge armor forher son. Under the superintendence
oi Vulcan the Cyclopes begin the task. 1

On the morrow Evander, promising from his own ieeble ³
resources a hand of cavalry under the command oi his son
Pallas, informs Aeneas oi the opportunity presented him hythe
Fates to become the leader oi a large and already organized
army. He tells him that the Etruscans have rebelled against
the tyrant Mezentius, and are encamped on the sea-coast await-
ing the foreign leader, without whose aid, as they are warned
by the gods, their enterprise cannot succeed. Aeneas is doubt-
less the leader intended hythe Fates. Encouraged by a favor-
able portent in the sky, Aeneas sends back his vessels, and sets
out on his march across the country with Pallas and his horsc—
men ior the camp ot the Etruscans at Caere. At night-fall the
band eneamps‚ and while Aeneas is engaged in meditation

apart from his companionS, he is visited by his mother Venus
who presents him the splendid helmet, coat-ot—mail, greaves,
spear‚ and shield that have been wrought ior him by Vulcan.
The remainder oi the book is devoted to a description of the
elaborate historical and symbolical ornamentation oi the shield.
